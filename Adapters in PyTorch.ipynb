Common strategies include adjusting only the final layer or fine-tuning all layers. However, these methods have their drawbacks: fine-tuning just the final layer often leads to less than optimal results, while fine-tuning all layers can be very time-consuming.\n","\n","To address these issues, researchers have developed various parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. One such technique involves the use of adapters. Adapters enable modular training, where small, task-specific modules are trained within the model without changing the pre-existing pretrained parameters. This approach efficiently tailors the model to new tasks with a reduced risk of overfitting. However, adapters are not a cure-all solution. While they are less likely to overfit and are computationally efficient, they might not always reach the same level of accuracy as full model fine-tuning, particularly if the task necessitates substantial changes from the pretrained model's original capabilities.\n","\n","In this hands-on lab, you learn how to apply an adapter to a transformer-based neural network that has been trained on the AG News data set, with the aim of using this model on the IMDB data set. You also evaluate and compare the performance of this method with that of a fully fine-tuned model and a model where only the last layer is fine-tuned.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1e665738-e0b0-4cb7-b167-30e5ce059520"},"source":["# __Table of contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a
